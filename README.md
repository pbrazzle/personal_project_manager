# Personal Project Manager - Preston Brazzle
## Overview
I want to make a project manager to handle my C++ projects. I want to handle the file structure, CMake files, and compilation of my project all from a single program. I would also like to add options to link dependencies in my CMake files.
## Features
- Create a new project in a given directory
- Create new sources files in a project
- Create new class files in a project (.cpp and .hpp)
- Generate a CMake file for a project
- Build and run a project
